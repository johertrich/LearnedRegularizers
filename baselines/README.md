# Baseline Methods

This folder contains the baseline methods, namely:

- two examples of supervised methods for CT: The FBP-UNet and Learned Primal Dual. Both networks are trained on the same LoDoPab subset we also use to train the learned regularisers. A link for downloading the trained weights for the FBP+UNet weights is provided in the subdirectory `fbpunet`.
- The TV reconstruction script
- A script to evaluate the standard DRUNet for Denoising
